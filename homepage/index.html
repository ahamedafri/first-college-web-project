                        Plastic pollution is killing wildlife, devastating oceans and threatening the health of our planet. Plastic represents a disconnection. It’s a material designed to last forever that we often use only once. Poorly managed plastic leaks into the sea. The ocean is downhill from everywhere.</p>

These chemical reactions are termed "ocean acidification" or "OA" for short. Calcium carbonate minerals are the building blocks for the skeletons and shells of many marine organisms. In areas where most life now congregates in the ocean, the seawater is supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate minerals.</p>

                        If you’ve been following our sustainability series, you’ll know that there are generally considered to be three parts to sustainability: economic, social and environmental. Sustainable fishing is no different. The Marine Stewardship Council defines sustainable fishing as: “Sustainable fishing means leaving enough fish in the ocean, respecting habitats and ensuring people who depend on fishing can maintain their livelihoods.” Maintaining fish stocks in the future means those reliant on fishing for their livelihood can continue to do so, that the countries who rely on fishing exports for their economy will still be able to benefit.</p>

                       <p class="blog-post_text">The small-scale fisheries sector tends to be firmly rooted in local communities, traditions and values.
                            Many small-scale fishers are self-employed and usually provide fish for direct consumption within their households or communities.
                             Women are significant participants in the sector, particularly in post-harvest and processing activities. It is estimated that about 90 percent of all people directly dependent on capture fisheries work in the small-scale fisheries sector.  Small-scale fisheries contribute about half of global fish catches. 
                           When considering catches destined for direct human consumption, the share contributed by the small-scale fisheries increases to two-thirds.</p>
