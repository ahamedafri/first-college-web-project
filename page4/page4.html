          <h1>What is sustainable fishing and why is it important?</h1>
          <p>
            If you’ve been following our sustainability series, you’ll know that there are generally considered to be three parts to sustainability: economic, social and environmental. Sustainable fishing is no different. The Marine Stewardship Council defines sustainable fishing as: “Sustainable fishing means leaving enough fish in the ocean, respecting habitats and ensuring people who depend on fishing can maintain their livelihoods.” 
            Maintaining fish stocks in the future means those reliant on fishing for their livelihood can continue to do so, that the countries who rely on fishing exports for their economy will still be able to benefit. Importantly to maintain the social and economic benefits of fishing, the methods need to change to prevent overfishing and damage to our aquatic ecosystems.

            <h2>The problems with the fishing industry</h2>
            <p style="color; white; ">Fishing hasn’t always been unsustainable. Indigenous communities across the world have been fishing sustainability for centuries using methods such as spearfishing. Today’s sustainable fishing practices reflect some lessons learned from these cultures.

            Increasing global demand and consumption of fish has led to fishing methods changing to catch the most fish with the least effort. These fishing practices have led to some of the issues we’re looking at below.

            <h3>Overfishing</h3>
            <p>The biggest, and most well-known, problem with the fishing industry is overfishing.

              Overfishing refers to catching too many fish of the same species consistently that that species’ survival is put at risk. It often happens when demand for a particular fish grows, increasing the capture of that species as the fishing industry looks to capitalize on the increased price.
              Though many regulations have been put in place to try and limit overfishing, it takes time for a species to fully recover, and, in the meantime, they’re still being fished.
              Bluefin tuna, a fish most of us will be aware of, is one example of the consequences of overfishing. Today’s spawning population of bluefin tuna is estimated to be at just 21-29% percent of what it was in 1970[6].</p>

            <h4>Illegal fishing</h4>
            <p>Illegal fishing, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing is another issue facing the fishing industry and undermining its sustainability efforts and is estimated to be worth US$10-23.5 billion annually[7].
              IUU contributes to the problem of overfishing and may involve catching a species that shouldn’t be caught or catching a species in too high a number.
              While there are regulations and legislation on waters closest to land, not all the world’s seas are governed as they lie outside of the control of one nation’s borders. In the case where international agreements apply, regulation is tricky as the prime fishing location may be many hundreds of miles away from land.</p>

            <h5>Destructive fishing</h5>
            <p>Destructive fishing refers to the methods that are used to catch fish. They can present a real danger to the environment and the future of aquatic ecosystems.
              Some methods of destructive fishing include bottom trawling, where giant nets are run along the seafloor picking up anything in their path including fragile corals and sponges[8]; cyanide fishing where sodium cyanide is squirted into the water to stun fish and make them easier to catch. There’s also dynamite fishing involving explosives being detonated underwater and collecting dead fish that rise to the surface[9]which comes with issues when done on a large scale</p>

            <h6>What’s being done?</h6>
            <p>In recent years, there has been an increase in awareness of overfishing and illegal fishing issues. There are certifications we can look out for on packaging and when we’re out at restaurants and more international agreements have been put in place.</p>
