    Oceans cover almost three quarters of the planet, the largest ecosystem on Earth.
    Large coastal populations in every region depend on them for their livelihoods and prosperity. 
    Oceans also provide priceless environmental services: 
    they generate half the oxygen we breathe, 
    support a wealth of marine resources and act as a climate regulator.
    Yet despite their critical importance, 
    the mounting impacts of climate change (including ocean acidification),
    overfishing and marine pollution are jeopardizing progress in protecting the worldâ€™s oceans. 
    Small island developing States are the most threatened. 
    Due to the transboundary nature of oceans, 
    marine resource management requires interventions at all levels (national,
    regional and global) to mitigate threats.
