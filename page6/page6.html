<h1><center>End Subsidies Contributing to Overfishing </center></h1>

<center><p><h2>Fisheries are a key source of protein and livelihoods for the millions in coastal communities, who are powerless by themselves to tackle the heavily subsidized industrial fishing boats and the overfishing that these involve.
<br>
    Fishing subsidies are estimated to be as high as $35 billion worldwide, of which $20 billion directly contributes to overfishing. According to FAO data, the percentage of stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels increased from 10 percent in 1974 to 34.2 percent in 2017.
    <br>
    These subsidies effectively mean that taxpayers are paying industrial boats to degrade the environment and to destroy the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable coastal communities. By fueling unfair competition between large fleets and individual artisanal fishermen, they are also fostering inequality.</h2></p></center>

    <h1>Overfishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean wildlife, livelihoods and seafood for future generations.</h1>
<center>
<h2>What is overfishing?</h2></center>
<center>
<h3>When too many fish are caught and there are not enough adults to breed and sustain a healthy population, the stock is overfished.</h3>
</center>
<center><h2>Why is overfishing a problem?</h2></center>
<center>
<h3>When a stock is overfished it is unsustainable. 
This can cause ecosystems to collapse with negative consequences for those who rely on a healthy ocean.</h3>
<br></center>
<h2>
The number of fish stocks that are overfished is increasing, with three times as many overfished stocks as there were in 1970. In total, a third of fish stocks are overfished.
<br>
Fishing that is unsustainable, illegal or destructive can seriously impact biodiversity. Overfishing not only affects the fish that are targeted for harvesting but other marine life that get caught up with fishing activities and vessels.
<br>
In the early 90s the impact of overfishing became increasingly obvious, culminating in the devastating collapse of Canada’s Grand Banks cod fishery in 1992. Over 35,000 fishers and plant workers from more than 400 coastal communities lost their jobs.
<br>
The Grand Banks collapse was one of the catalysts for the creation of the MSC and our Fisheries Standard, which reflects the most up-to-date understanding of internationally accepted fisheries science and management.
<br>
If overfishing continues, there will not be enough fish left in the ocean to feed future generations. MSC analysis shows we are currently missing out on enough protein for 72 million more people every year, because fisheries have not been managed for the long-term. But if sustainable fishing practices are adopted, that protein need could be met – by fishing less, we could have more fish in the long-term.
